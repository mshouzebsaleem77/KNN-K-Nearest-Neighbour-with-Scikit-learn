# KNN-K-Nearest-Neighbour-with-Scikit-learn

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is one of the simplest algorithms used in Machine Learning for regression and classification problem. KNN algorithms use data and classify new data points based on similarity measures (e.g. distance function). Classification is done by a majority vote to its neighbors

## Libraries:
1. Scikit-learn
2. Numpy
3. Pandas
4. Matplotlib

## Run Project:
Simply download/clone the project and run KNN file on jupyter notebook or any other tool.
